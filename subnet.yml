# in my idea

# so, I gonna create two subnets for each LAMP Stack
- import_playbook: webserver1_subnet.yml
- import_playbook: webserver2_subnet.yml
- import_playbook: app1_subnet.yml
- import_playbook: app2_subnet.yml
- import_playbook: db1_subnet.yml
- import_playbook: db2_subnet.yml
- import_playbook: lb1_subnet.yml
- import_playbook: lb2_subnet.yml

# next I am gonna create nat to connect private instances
# connect all subnets to routing table
# each stack group I added routing table and association
# 2 webserver to web routing table likewise

# I am gonna create subnet group to have an database cluster
